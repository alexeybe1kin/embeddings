"""Embeddings — text to vectors, and nothing else.

One job, one boundary. It holds no memory, takes no action and observes no
machine; it turns text into vectors and reports honestly when it cannot.

Existing as a separate service is the point. MemoryGate previously loaded a
model inside its own API process, which tied a web API's startup to a model
load and made the provider unswappable. Behind an HTTP contract the model is a
deployment choice: swapping it is a compose change, not a rewrite. See ADR-0004
and ADR-0007 in the Conker repository.
